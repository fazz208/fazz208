- 👋 Hi, I’m @fazz208
- 👀 I’m interested in the 3DS, playing games and recently the programming language of C++!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++ so I can create desktop and 3DS/DS homebrew applications!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a 3DS downloader app like FBI which can scan QR codes and read links then downloads them!
- 📫 Reach me via Discord; tag is pronker#0580!
